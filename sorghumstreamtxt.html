<b>Sorghum</b><br>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%;">
The US total sorghum supplies depended on domestic production in ~40 years and imports were trivial except in 2012, when import volume suddenly surged to 9.57 million metric tons, hundreds of times as much as import volumes in previous years. An interesting observation is that ending stock / beginning stock shrinked quickly to nearly zero after 1993, implying that total supplies and total demand balanced out. Before 2010, sorghum domestic use was dominated by feed use, whereas food use grew to the main demand of sorghum supplies after 2011.
