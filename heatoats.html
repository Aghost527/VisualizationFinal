<b>Heatmap</b><br>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%;">
The heatmaps show the US monthly total export volumes, import volumes, and net exports for each grain from 1989 to 2016. The data is discretized into five intervals and represented by five colors. Net exports is equal to export volumes subtract import volume and net imports is the other way around.<br><br>

<b>Oats</b><br>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%;">
The US oats imports have maintained high volumes since 1993. Itâ€™s quite interesting that exports from 1992 to present are not as trivial as volumes before 1992. The possible reason is either domestic oats production was sufficiently high for exports or part of import volumes were exported. Since the US is oats importer, rather than oats exporter, a heatmap for oats net imports is designed.
