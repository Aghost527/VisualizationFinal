The US is the worldâ€™s largest producer and exporter of corn, and yet domestic use consumes a majority of total supplies. Production has increased steadily over time since 1975. Imports also has risen, especially over recent years, to meet the ever increasing domestic demand. Additionally, the US has maintained high export volumes over ~40 years with occasional slight fluctuations, indicating importance of corn to the US economy as it contributes significantly to the US agricultural trade balance. Another prominent observation on corn consumption pattern reveals that corn has been consumed primarily by food use, rather than by feed use since 2008, which implies increments in intake of corn by the US people, in line with their pursuit of health diets.
