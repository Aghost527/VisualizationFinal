The US barley supply pattern has not transformed greatly, as total supplies always relied on domestic production. However, consumption pattern has evolved. The total demand was initially dominated by feed use. After 1997, feed use has been replaced by food use, which accounted for more than half of total supplies. Plus, import volumes have expanded since 1992 and reached the peak of 71.48 million metric tons in 1993, while export volumes have diminished after 2009.
