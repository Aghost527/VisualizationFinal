The world map demonstrates the US trading partners for corn, sorghum, barley, and oats. By selecting a particular year and grain, users can view all countries that trade with the US on the grain in the given year. Annual trading volumes are discretized into five intervals and each is illustrated by a color. The darker the color, the higher the trading volume. When a mouse hovers over a country, trading volume between it and the US will appear.
