Apparently, the US total oats supplies and total disappearance have shrunk all along years. The supply pattern has transformed significantly, where the major source of supplies has shifted from domestic production to imports since 2006. In fact, the US farmers instead of growing oats, have chosen to plant more profitable crops, such as soybean in recent years. Decrease of feed use, implying a shrinkage in acreage devoted to oats, from another perspective predicts drastic reduction of the US domestic oats output. Meanwhile, food use has expanded steadily over years and feed use has declined.
