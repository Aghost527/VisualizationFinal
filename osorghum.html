<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%;">  The US feed grain total supplies consist of domestic production, imports, and beginning stock, where domestic production contributes the most. The feed grains are consumed by food use, feed use, seed use and exports, where the first three are grouped as domestic use. When users select a specific year, corresponding data will be shown or highlighted.<br><br>

The US sorghum production has experienced decreases roughly over ~40 years and slightly increased over recent a couple of years. It was demanded mainly as a feed ingredient before 2011. However, lately sorghum has been consumed more by food use similar to corn for the same reason. In general, total demand and total supplies have dropped since the end of 20th century, as demand of feed use has decreased sharply. Import volume surged in 2012 to respond to a sudden decrease of sorghum production and increase in food use demand. Besides, seed use also has decreased over nearly 30 years, suggesting a shrinkage in the growth of sorghum and explaining the constant reduction of production. Consequently, sorghumâ€™s share of the US feed grain production probably drops.
