<b>Heatmap</b><br>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%;">
The heatmaps show the US monthly total export volumes, import volumes, and net exports for each grain from 1989 to 2016. The data is discretized into five intervals and represented by five colors. Net exports is equal to export volumes subtract import volume and net imports is the other way around.<br><br>

<b>Sorghum</b><br>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%;">
The US sorghum exports soared in the first half of 1990s and during 2013 to 2015. Similar to corn, imports ballooned in 2012, because of shortage of domestics production. The net exports heatmap shows that the US does not import sorghum at all! It may result from low domestic use.
