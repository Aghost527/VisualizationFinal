Planted / harvested acreage is a good measurement for importance of each grain to the US economy, since the most of arable land will surely be allocated to the crop whose contributions to the US economy is the most significant. Undoubtedly, corn has enjoyed a leading position over ~150 years from 1866 to 2016. However, oats had been in the second most important position for ~100 years and then replaced sorghum in 1970s. <br><br>


By comparing the data with history over the same time span, it’s to our surprise that the corn data perfectly reflect the history. In other words, the corn data narrates the history! When users click line segments highlighted by different colors in the timeline, corresponding historical moments and the time will be displayed.  <br><br>


In the second half of 19th century, the homestead act and railroad boom brought millions of migrants and planted acreage increased sharply from 1860 to 1910 correspondingly. During World War I, to respond to disruption of european agricultural production, the US increased both acreage and production to meet the overseas demand. Prices of crops surged as well. In 1930s, the US experienced severe droughts called the Dust Bowl. It almost destroyed the entire agriculture in the middle and south US. We can observe a drastic drop in production and harvested acreage. In 1930s, all-purpose rubber tired tractors penetrated and yield per acre beginned to balloon. After 1945, as new machinery and new technologies were introduced and popularized, the yield per acre increased dramatically. In market year of 2012 and 2013, we observe a surge in crop price. It actually results from a severe drought with a peak on July 2012. It caused crop production dropped and price rose. During 2012-2013, the North American Droughts, resulted from low snowfall amounts in winter and the intense summer heat from La Niña, caused drought-like conditions to migrate northward from the southern United States, wreaking havoc on crops and water supply. Corn production in 2012 reached a local minimum. To meet total demands, import volumes grew sharply. Correspondly, export volume fell dramatically and corn price also surged drastically.  <br><br>
