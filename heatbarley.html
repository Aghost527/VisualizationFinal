<b>Heatmap</b><br>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%;">
The heatmaps show the US monthly total export volumes, import volumes, and net exports for each grain from 1989 to 2016. The data is discretized into five intervals and represented by five colors. Net exports is equal to export volumes subtract import volume and net imports is the other way around.<br><br>

<b>Barley</b><br>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%;">
The US barley exports soared in 1990s and diminished thereafter. Different from corn and sorghum, imports increased dramatically in 1993 and 1994, rather than in 2012, when the US suffered the great droughts. The heatmap for net exports suggest that the US has shifted from barley exporter to importer during the ~40 years.
